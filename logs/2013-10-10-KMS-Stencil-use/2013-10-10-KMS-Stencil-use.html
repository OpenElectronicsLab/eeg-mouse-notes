<h1 class="title">Stencil use notes for 2013-10-10</h1>
</div>
<p>On the evening of 2013-10-10 I (KMS) attempted to use the &quot;Complete prototype stencil&quot; kit we had ordered from <a href="http://advancedcircuits.com">Advanced Circuits</a> to solder the surface mount components of an arduino-ads1298 rev1 board. The results were a mixed success, with the most significant issues probably being attributable to my lack of experience with solder stencils.</p>
<p>I first secured the board by using the right angle pieces of (of FR4?) from the stencil kit. The right angle pieces were taped to the table with painter's tape so that they applied a small amount of compression to the PCB. No tape was used on the PCB itself, but the angle pieces seemed to hold it securely.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The stencil was next carefully aligned to the PCB by eye with the flat edge of the stencil facing upwards. The next time it may be better to place the flat edge of the stencil downwards, for reasons I'll explain below. Once the stencil was aligned, it was taped by the flat edge to the angle brackets and table, forming a hinge.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>This taping provided surprisingly good registration of the stencil within the plane of the table, but not vertically; in the absence of pressure from above, the stencil would bend slightly away from the PCB in places. This may have contributed to the problems of solder spreading mentioned below. I don't know of an easy way to reduce this given the thinness of the stencil. Probably the professional frames stretch the stencil, like an artist's canvas, to make sure it remains flat. It's not clear if building or buying such a frame would be worth the time or expense for a prototype like this, however.</p>
<p>I next applied lead-free solder paste (Best BT705 Sn:90%, Cu:7% Ag:3%, from <a href="http://sparkfun.com">SparkFun</a>) to the squeegee included with the stencil kit. (Note the vertical space visible between the stencil and the board in this picture)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="IMG_20131010_210834.jpg" alt="Stencil paste applied to squeegee" /><p class="caption">Stencil paste applied to squeegee</p>
</div>
<p>The amount of solder paste was possibly a little low, but in the right range. I then tried to apply the solder paste by swiping the squeegee downward across the stencil at about a 30 degree angle. When I reached the lower edge of the stencil, however, I was forced to increase the angle so that my fingers would clear the vertical lip at the lower edge of the board. At first I tried to take a few more passes to push the solder paste downwards; this was probably a bad idea, however, both because it was not very successful and may have lead to the smearing mentioned below. I then tried swiping upwards towards the flat edge of the stencil; this worked, leaving a thin layer of solder covering the stencil, but swiping upward felt a bit more awkward. Facing the flat edge of the stencil downwards, and mentioned above, and slowly decreasing the angle during the swipe would probably be a better idea next time.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I then did a second pass with a more vertical position of the squeegee (about 60 degrees). The squeegee flexed away from the board wherever my hands were not holding it, however, leaving a thin layer of solder. As a result, I ended up again taking multiple swipes to remove all of the excess solder. Perhaps something stiffer than the squeegee, like a baker's bench scraper, would have worked better.</p>

<p>I then carefully hinged the stencil away from the board. I think this style of lifting would have worked well if the previous steps had not smeared the solder; this will have to be confirmed in future attempts, however.</p>

<p>Note the smearing of solder paste in the images below; solder paste from multiple pins overlaps, and the solder paste extends beyond where the apertures were in the stencil.</p>

<p>If I were to do this again, at this point I would wipe the solder paste off the board and wipe it down with isopropyl alcohol, then try using the stencil again to see if I could get a better result. I wasn't that wise this time, however, so I went with the smudged solder paste shown above.</p>
<p>I then remembered that there was a ground loop we accidentally introduced into this version of the board. I used my pocket knife to cut the foil so that the RESV1 pin connected to just the digital ground (and not both the digital and analog ground. It looked like I was successful when I looked at this under the scope, but I'm not certain. This would have been much better to do before applying solder paste; although I did not notice it at the time, I think I put my finger on the solder paste near one of the inductors while holding the board to do this (the solder paste on that inductor looked very thin).</p>

<p>I then used forceps to place components on the board. I used a print-out of components grouped by value, and then added the components by grabbing a bag of components from the mouser order, looking up the appropriate component on the paper to find the component references (e.g. R16 or C65) that used that component, and then placing the components on the board and checking off the references on the sheet as I placed the parts. While I usually had a good sense of where each component went, in a number of cases I had to pull up the board in kicad and use the find feature to find a particular reference on the board.</p>
<p>I ran into several small problems while doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 0603 component references were sometimes very difficult to read due to the limited resolution of the silk screen. It may be worth increasing the font size for these components on future boards. The 0805 component references, while still small, were much more readable.</li>
<li>I sometimes struggled with the physical alignment of the components, especially the 0.5 mm pitch ICs. This will probably improve with practice, but lead to additiona smearing of solder paste.</li>
<li>The CAT24C128 EEPROM was narrow for the footprint we're using. I ended up soldering it to the pads on one side, and plan to solder small wires between the pads and pins on the other side.</li>
<li>There was no dot for pin 1 for the CAT24C128 footprint. I was able to look this up in KiCad, but we should fix the footprint so that it shows the chip's orientation.</li>
<li>The Si8606 we ordered was the narrow version, but we use the footprint of the wide version. I cleaned the solder paste off of the pads for these chips to simplify later hand soldering, using bits of paper towell held with the forceps to wipe it away.</li>
<li>I had ordered a 6.3V version of the 0805 10uF capacitors because Mouser was out of the version on our parts list, then later thought better of this and ordered a 10V version from digikey. When I went to place the components, however, I carelessly placed the 6.3V ones. These will probably work for the light duty our prototype will face, but they aren't really appropriately derated for use with the 5V power lines. Thus I may desolder the ones used of the 5V lines and replace them with the higher rated components.</li>
<li>The 1210 10uF capacitors (50V) don't seem to have the right footprint on the schematic. We may need to back-annotate these again.</li>
<li>The footprint for the Zener diode seemed much larger than needed. It may have been recommended for thermal reasons, however, and there is no problem soldering the part into the footprint. This is worth double checking with the data sheet, however.</li>
<li>Placing the components took me over five hours, which is much longer than the 1 hour maximum solder paste working time I've seen recommended. I may get faster with practice, but some of this may be unavoidable when hand placing this many components. This didn't cause any obvious problems, however, and the solder paste did not harden during this time. Perhaps temperature and humidity have a large effect, with the 1 hour window assuming a warm day without air conditioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spacing between the 0603 components seemed more than adequate when using solder paste, and we could probably place the larger components this close to eachother if needed without causing problems for us.</li>
<li>I soldered in the alternative components for the filters, namely: 0 Ohm resistors for R1-R16 and R55, nothing for C1-C16 and C99, 4.99 kOhm metal-film resistors for R17-R32 and R56, and 4.7 nF capacitors for C17-C32 and C101.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally the board went into the toaster oven.</p>

<p>The thermostat does not seem to be working on the toaster at the moment, so it was simply &quot;on&quot; After a delay the various patches of solder paste went through liquidus in rapid succession, as assessed by the change from gray to shiny. I then waited another 30 seconds or so, which probably wasn't a good idea as then a faint amount of smoke appeared. Upon noting the smoke I quickly opened the oven, turning it off and cooling the board. Again, this may have been more rapid cooling than would be ideal. From previous experience, however, it seems likely that this did not seriously harm the components, as nothing was visibly molten, cracked, or scorched.</p>
<p>The overall results appeared to be reasonably good:</p>

<p>There are a lot of solder bridges that will need to be cleaned up. Less smearing of the solder may help with this.</p>
